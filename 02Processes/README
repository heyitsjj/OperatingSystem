Question1:
Original code output is
i = 0
j = 0
i = 1
i = 2
j = 1
j = 2

The first while loop created 3 child processes, say c0, c1, c2
c0 did not create any grand child process
c1 created 1 child processes in inner while loop, gc0
c2 created 2 child processes in inner while loop, gc1 and gc2
so there are totally 6 child and grand child processes are created.
